        numpy (for numerical computations)
        opencv-python (for video processing)
        scipy (for scientific computations)
        pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
        matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)
        git-lfs (for managing large files)

Hardware Requirements

    CPU: Multi-core processor recommended for faster training
    RAM: At least 8GB of RAM

Dataset Details

The Lip Sync project utilizes a dataset of videos and corresponding audio files for training and testing the lip synchronization model.

    Input Data:
        Video Files: The dataset consists of a collection of muted video clips where subjects are speaking. Each video clip is analyzed to extract the lip movements corresponding to the spoken audio.
        Audio Files: Audio clips corresponding to each video are used during the training phase to teach the model the relationship between lip movements and speech.

    Data Format:
        The videos are in standard formats (e.g., MP4, AVI) and have been preprocessed to a uniform resolution (e.g., 75 frames height, 46 frames width, 140 channels).
        The audio files are in compatible audio formats (e.g., WAV) and are paired with their corresponding video clips.

    Size: The dataset contains approximately [insert number] video clips and corresponding audio files, amounting to roughly [insert total size] of data.

Data Usage

    Training: During the training phase, both video and audio data are utilized to train the model to understand the mapping between lip movements and spoken language.
    Testing: For testing, only the video clips are used (muted) to evaluate how well the model can predict the text based on lip movements.
